// Inheritance is a key part of OOP

// A class can extend another class
// The subclass uses the extends keyword

// The class that has been extended is called the superclass
// The subclass can override superclass methods
// The subclass can invoke superclass methods and constructors, via the super keyword

// A good example is having a superclass of Animal and a subclass of Dog that extends it.
// The Animal class will have a move method which will be overridden to be specific to Dog

// N.B. Under the covers, TypeScript inehritance is transpiled into prototypical inheritance in JavaScript

// Additional techniques in the superclass:
// Can be abstract (cannot instantiate) - useful for classes that are too non-specific (e.g. Animal)
// Can have abstract methods (must be overridden) - e.g. Animal having an abstract method called makeNoise(), that must be overridden for each animal
// Can have protected members (accessible to subclasses)

// Additional techniques in client code:
// Type-checks via instanceof
// Type-casts via as and <type>

// See below example relating to Film Reviews - which can be brief or critical
// N.B. This would usually be separated across a few files

// Superclass
