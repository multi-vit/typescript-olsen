let numbers: number[] = [1, 2];
// or
let foods: Array<string> = ["Pizza", "Chocolate"];

// Both ways of typing are fine and are directly equivalent
// Either <type>[] or Array<type>

// Remember we can use type inference for the above examples
// We have just explicity typed to demonstrate syntax
